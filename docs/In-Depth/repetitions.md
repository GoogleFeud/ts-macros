# Repetitions

ts-macro has **repetitions** which are heavily inspired by Rust. They allow you to repeat code for every element of an array. Since ts-macros is limited by the typescript compiler, this is the syntax for repetitions:

```
+[separator?, [arrays], (...params) => codeToRepeat]
```

The `separator` is an optional string which will separate all the expressions generated by the repetition. If a separator is omitted, then every expression will be an `ExpressionStatement`. 

`[arrays]` is an array of array literals. The elements in the arrays are the things the repetition will go through. This is the simplest repetition:

```ts --Macro
function $test(...numbers: Array<number>) {
    +[[numbers, ["a", "b", "c"]], (num: number|string) => console.log(num)]
}

$test!(1, 2, 3);
```
```ts --Result
console.log(1)
console.log(2)
console.log(3)
console.log("a")
console.log("b")
console.log("c")
```

The repetition goes through all the numbers and strings, and creates a `console.log` expression for each of them. Easy!

## Multiple elements in repetition

Let's say you want to go through 2 or more arrays **at the same time**, to create combinations like `1a`, `2b`, etc. You can accomplish this by adding another parameter:

```ts --Macro
function $test(...numbers: Array<number>) {
    +[[numbers, ["a", "b", "c"]], (firstArr: number, secondArr: string) => console.log(firstArr + secondArr)]
}

$test!(1, 2, 3);
```
```ts --Result
console.log("1a")
console.log("2b")
console.log("3c")
```

The second parameter tells the transformer to separate **the second array** from the rest. So `firstArr` goes through all arrays **except** the second array (`["a", "b", "c"]`), and in this case the two arrays just get separated. But what if we add a third array?

```ts --Macro
function $test(...numbers: Array<number>) {
    +[[numbers, ["a", "b", "c"], ["e", "d", "f"]], (all: number, secondArr: string) => console.log(firstArr + secondArr)]
}

$test!(1, 2, 3);
```
```ts --Result
console.log("1a")
console.log("2b")
console.log("3c")
console.log("e" + null)
console.log("d" + null)
console.log("f" + null)
```

Here `firstArr` goes through the first array and the third array, and `secondArr` goes through the second. The second array only has 3 elements, and so it's `null` for the elements of the third array.

## Separators

You can use the following separators:

- `+` - Adds all the values.
- `-` - Subtracts all the values.
- `*` - Multiplies all the values.
- `.` - Creates a property / element access chain from the values.
- `[]` - Puts all the values in an array.
- `{}` - Creates an object literal from the values. For this separator to work, the result of the repetition callback must be an array literal with 2 elements, the key and the value (`[key, value]`).
- `()` - Creates a comma list expression from all expressions.
- `||` - Creates an OR chain with the expressions. 
- `&&` - Creates an AND chain with the expressions.

## Repetitions as function arguments

If a repetition is placed inside of a function call, and a separator is **not** provided, then all results will be passed as arguments.

```ts --Macro
function $log(...items: Array<number>) {
    console.log(+[[items], (item: number) => item + 1]);
}
```
```ts --Call
$log!(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
```
```ts --Result
console.log(2, 3, 4, 5, 6);
```

## $$i built-in macro

ts-macros provides a built-in macro, `$$i`, if used inside a repetition, it'll return the number of the current iteration, if it's used outside, `-1`.

```ts --Macro
import { $$i } from "../../dist";

function $arr(...els: Array<number>) : Array<number> {
    return +["[]", [els], (el: number) => el + $$i!()] as unknown as Array<number>;
}
```
```ts --Call
$arr!(1, 2, 3);
```
```ts --Result
[1, 3, 5]
```
